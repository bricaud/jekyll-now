I am interested in data science, graphs, networks and practical applications of scientific methods to real world data.

I see programming as a creative process and data sience as a set of challenges stimuling creativity, combining mathematical rigor and artistic skills.

I am curious and I need to learn new things every day.

I have a background in Physics and Mathematics. I have spend many years in various research labs analysing data or designing new methods for data analysis. The last years, I focused on graphs and their fascinating properties.
